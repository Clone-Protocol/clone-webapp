This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Switching Networks

In the `.env.local` file you can set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_NETWORK` variable to either `LOCAL_NET` or `DEV_NET` (will default to `LOCAL_NET`). This will switch the network endpoint and program IDs to the default values defined in `sdk/src/network.ts`.

You may also override these values by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLONE_PROGRAM_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ENDPOINT` variables.

Keep in mind the variables are loaded at startup and will not change until you restart the application.
